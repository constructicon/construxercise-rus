Construxercise! is a language learning resource that offers learners and teachers of Russian over 150 exercises that significantly strengthen text production skills. The exercises target strategic sets of Russian constructions (prominent patterns of sentence and phrase structures) that organize the flow of speech and help to achieve native-like fluency in speaking and writing. 

Construxercise! helps to:

- practice your speaking and writing
- clearly structure your statements
- make it easy to generate a text, either spoken or written, on your own

## Construction-based approach

A language is more than just words and grammar rules. Construxercise! presents ready-to-use communicative patterns that you can employ to build confidence and proficiency. Learning Russian by its constructions is a strategic and research-based approach inspired by the theory of language called Construction Grammar. All constructions you will learn in Construxercise! are thoroughly described and illustrated in the Russian Constructicon, a large collection of over 4000 Russian constructions available at https://constructicon.github.io/russian/. 


## Level

The resourse's vocabulary and grammar target A2-B1 levels of language proficiency (according to CEFR, the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). Bonus exercises employ more advanced vocabulary to benefit the learners at levels B2-C1. 

## Exercises by lessons and by functions

The exercises are grouped by lessons and by functions. Each of the twelve lessons introduces a group of five to six constructions using vocabulary and grammar connected to a given topic. On the page “Lessons” the user can find twelve lessons for topics like Работа (Getting a job), Поход к врачу (Going to the doctor), Внешность (Personal appearance), etc. Each lesson takes approximately 60 minutes to complete and contains 12 to 15 exercises.

Alternatively, one can access the exercises on the page “Functions” where they are grouped according to why they are used: to express one's subjective opinion, to add information, to clarify one's point, etc. The exercises encourage learners to engage in speaking and writing. Most constructions are stylistically neutral and can be used in a wide variety of genres and topics. Some constructions are colloquial.

Our philosophy is that the more you produce Russian on your own, the more you learn (learning-by-doing). You can train in speaking and writing already at early stages of learning Russian. We focus on simple constructions that enrich your language skills, make your speech more fluent, native-like, and give you confidence to engage in conversation.
